- This is built accroding to ROBINS-I-V2, https://www.riskofbias.info/welcome/robins-i-v2, created for National Drug & Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Australia.

- The risk of bias form is only saved upon clicking the SAVE button on the form.

- "No" is the unique identification number for each study. It must be entered.

- To remove a record, delete the row in both "Summary" and "Data" sheets.

- If you need to write a note or predict direction of bias for each domain, just put them in the box located at the last page. If you really need one at each page, submit a pull request and I will try to make one for you.

- Automatic generation of risk of bias figure will be added later.
