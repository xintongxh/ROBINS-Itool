This is built accroding to ROBINS-I-V2, https://www.riskofbias.info/welcome/robins-i-v2.

The file is compatible with Onedrive autosave.

The risk of bias form is only saved upon clicking the SAVE button on the form.

"No" is the unique identification number for each study.

To remove a record, delete the row in both "Summary" and "Data" sheets.

If you need to write a note or predict direction of bias for each domain, just put them in the box located at the last page. 
If you really need one at each page, submit a pull request and I will try to make one for you.

Automatic generation of risk of bias figure will be added later.
